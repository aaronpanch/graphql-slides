# Act 1: Purpose

</Layout>

---

Deeper dive/workshop sessions planned for March

---

## The Stack

---

ROR / GraphQL --> React / Apollo

---

## Since we last spoke...

---

- Signal Discovery front-end is ~95% GraphQL/Apollo
- ~75% in tracked work (in a planned epic), the rest via natural refactoring
- Still want to marry the stack

---

## What is GraphQL?

---

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

---

## But wait! There's more!

---

- Great at consolidating multiple data sources
- Type/Resolver/Query/Mutation strategy is simple and clean
- Great libraries/tools like Apollo and GraphiQL make life easier

## An Example

Imagine we were building a theatre production API. It will tell us what shows we can see in our area.

</Layout>

---

<img src={mockup} alt="Theatreflix Mockup" />

---

Makes sense?

---

<Layout>

### **1.** Start by asking how your data **will be used**.

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

Our initial inclination might be to think about...

</Layout>

---

<CodeSurfer theme={myTheme}>

```graphql
type Play {
  title: String!
  author: String!
  genre: [String]!
}
```

```graphql
type Play {
  title: String!
  author: String!
  genre: [String]!
}

type Production {
  play: Play!
  venue: Theatre!
}
```

```graphql
type Play {
  title: String!
  author: String!
  genre: [String]!
}

type Production {
  play: Play!
  venue: Theatre!
}

type Theatre {
  address: String!
}
```

```graphql
query {
  nearbyShows(around: [Number!, Number!]!) {
    title
    directors
    theatre {
      address
    }
  }
}
```

```diff 1[1:5]

```

```diff 2[2:13]

```

```diff 3:7

```

```graphql
query {
  nearbyShows(around: [Number!, Number!]!, after: String) {
    title
    directors
    theatre {
      address
    }
    cursor
  }
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<Layout>

### **2.** Take time to **describe** your data **before** implementing.

</Layout>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```graphql
type Production {
}
```

```graphql
type Production {
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql
type Production {
  name: String!
  play: String!
}
```

```graphql
type Production {
  name: String!
  play: String!
  directors: [String!]
}
```

```graphql
type Production {
  name: String!
  play: String!
  directors: [String!]
  theatre: Theatre!
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Layout>

### **3.** You don't need to expose **everything**.

</Layout>

---

<CodeSurferColumns>

<Step>

```ruby
class Production < ApplicationModel
  fields do
    name :string
  end

  belongs_to :theatre
  has_many   :directors
  has_many   :actors
  belongs_to :play
end
```

```graphql
type Production {
  name: String!
  play: Play!
  directors: [Person!]
  theatre: Theatre!
}

type Play {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}

type Person {
  name: String!
}

type Theatre {
  ...
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

```ruby
class Production < ApplicationModel
  fields do
    name :string
  end

  belongs_to :theatre
  has_many   :directors
  has_many   :actors
  belongs_to :play
end
```

```graphql
type Production {
  name: String!
  play: String!
  directors: [String!]
  theatre: Theatre!
}

type Theatre {
  ...
}
```

</Step>

</CodeSurferColumns>

Don't _need_ a 1:1 for **Models**:**Types**
