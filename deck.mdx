### **1.** _Start_ with how your data will be used.

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

## For Example

Imagine we were building a theatre production API. It will tell us what shows we can see in our area.

</Layout>

Our initial inclination might be to think about

---

<CodeSurfer>

```graphql
type Play {
  title: String!
  author: String!
  genre: [String]!
}
```

```graphql
type Play {
  title: String!
  author: String!
  genre: [String]!
}

type Production {
  play: Play!
  venue: Venue!
}
```

```graphql
type Play {
  title: String!
  author: String!
  genre: [String]!
}

type Production {
  play: Play!
  venue: Venue!
}

type Venue {
  address: String!
}
```

```graphql
query {
  nearbyVenues(location: [Number!, Number!]) {
    shows {
      title
      genre
    }
  }
}
```

```diff 2[2:14]

```

```graphql
query {
  nearbyVenues(location: [Number!, Number!]) {
    shows {
      title
      genre
    }
    hasMore
  }
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

### **2:** Take time to _describe_ your data before implementing.

</Layout>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```graphql
type Venue {
}
```

```graphql
type Venue {
  address: String!
}
```

```graphql
type Venue {
  address: String!
  shows: [Production]!
}
```

```graphql
type Venue {
  address: String!
  shows: [Production]!
  hasMore: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeSurfer>
